# Contributing to stuxiedev.github.io

This is a minimal GitHub Pages redirect page (`index.html`) that forwards visitors from `stuxiedev.github.io` to [stuxie.dev](https://stuxie.dev/). This document is for anyone working on the redirect page itself.

## Local setup

There's no build step or dependencies — just open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the directory with any static file server, e.g.:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

## Project conventions

- Single static `index.html` — no framework, no build step, no backend.
- Keep it minimal; this repo exists only to redirect GitHub Pages traffic.

## Versioning

This project uses [Date Versioning](https://datevers.ing). To release:

1. Add a `## vYY.MM.DD` entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`, with its sections in this order: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Security, Deprecated.
2. Set `VERSION.md` to the same bare version (no `v`): today's **UTC** date as `YY.MM.DD`, or `YY.MM.DD-1`, `-2`… for later releases the same UTC day. Never a future date. Use UTC, not local time: just after midnight in the UK it is still the previous day in UTC.
3. Run `bash tests/version.sh`.
4. Run `./commit.sh` (or `commit.bat` on Windows). It checks the version, commits and tags `vYY.MM.DD`, and never pushes.

## Before committing

- Open `index.html` in a browser and confirm the redirect fires correctly
